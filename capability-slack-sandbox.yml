      title: Slack Admin API
      description: >-
        The Slack Admin API is a set of privileged endpoints primarily under
        admin.* with related SCIM and Audit Logs APIs that lets Enterprise Grid
        owners and admins automate organization-wide management and governance.
        It covers user lifecycle (provision, suspend, assign roles), workspace
        and channel administration across workspaces (create, move, archive
        channels; manage membership and settings), app governance (approve/deny
        or allowlist/ban apps and install them to workspaces), invite request
        handling, and security/compliance controls such as information barriers,
        session and authentication policies, and org-level analytics exports.

      title: Slack Apps API
      description: >-
        The Slack Apps API is a set of platform APIs and tools that let
        developers build apps to extend Slack and automate work. With it, you
        can read and write data via the Web API (messages, channels, files,
        reactions), receive real-time events using the Events API or Socket
        Mode, and create interactive experiences with Block Kit, modals,
        buttons, shortcuts, and slash commands. Apps can post messages, run
        workflows, add custom steps to Workflow Builder, manage conversations,
        and act as bot users. Installation uses OAuth 2.0 with granular
        permission scopes and token types, and enterprise features are supported
        through admin APIs.

      title: Slack Auth API
      description: >-
        Slack's Auth API covers the authentication and authorization pieces that
        let apps securely identify users and workspaces and manage access. It
        includes OAuth 2.0 endpoints used during app installation to request
        scopes and exchange authorization codes for tokens (with optional token
        rotation), plus OpenID Connect for "Sign in with Slack" so you can
        authenticate users and retrieve standard identity claims. Within the Web
        API, methods like auth.test let you verify a token and learn which user
        and workspace it belongs to, auth.revoke allows you to invalidate
        tokens, and auth.teams.list helps enumerate the workspaces a user can
        use with your app (useful for multi-workspace and Enterprise Grid
        scenarios). Together, these capabilities ensure your app knows who is
        calling, what it's allowed to do, and where, before invoking other Slack
        APIs.

      title: Slack Bots API
      description: "Slack\x19s bot APIs let you build apps that live in Slack and automate work by listening for events and taking actions in conversations. Using the Web API, your bot can post and schedule messages, reply in threads, manage channels, look up users, and access files or reactions; the Events API delivers message, reaction, and workflow events to your server so you can respond in real time. Bots can power slash commands, message shortcuts, and interactive UI elements (buttons, menus, modals built with Block Kit), and they can open modals or update messages dynamically. Installation and access are controlled via OAuth 2.0 scopes, with bot tokens used to authenticate API calls; you can receive events over HTTPS or via Socket Mode if you don\x19t host a public endpoint. Together, these capabilities let you create assistants that answer questions, route approvals, connect external services, and streamline team processes directly inside Slack."

      title: Slack Calls API
      description: >-
        Slack's Calls API lets apps represent third-party voice or video calls
        inside Slack  by creating a "call" object with a join URL and metadata,
        so users see a rich call  message with a Join button, status, and
        participant list in channels or DMs. Through  endpoints to create,
        update, and end calls—and to add or remove participants—an app  can keep
        that call message in sync as people join or leave and as the call
        progresses.  The API doesn't handle the media itself; it's for
        coordinating and rendering the Slack  UI around calls hosted by services
        like Zoom or Webex, making it easy to start, find,  and join those calls
        from Slack.

      title: Slack Chat API
      description: >-
        The Slack Chat API is the set of chat.* methods in the Slack Web API
        that lets apps and bots create and manage messages in Slack workspaces.
        It enables posting messages to channels and DMs with Block Kit
        formatting, sending ephemeral messages visible only to a specific user,
        replying in threads, scheduling messages for later delivery, updating or
        deleting existing messages, retrieving permalinks, and providing custom
        link unfurls. These methods work over HTTP with JSON payloads, use
        bot/user tokens with scopes like chat:write and chat:write.public, and
        return metadata such as channel, ts, and thread_ts. Teams use the Chat
        API to automate notifications, power interactive workflows, and deliver
        rich conversational experiences inside Slack.

      title: Slack Conversations API
      description: >-
        The Slack Conversations API is the unified Web API for working with all
        types of Slack  conversations—public and private channels, direct
        messages, and multi-person DMs. It lets  apps discover and inspect
        conversations, list members, and read message history and threads,  as
        well as create, join, invite, leave, and archive channels where
        permissions allow. By  consolidating the legacy channels.*, groups.*,
        im.*, and mpim.* endpoints into conversations.*,  it provides consistent
        IDs and behavior across conversation types. It supports cursor-based 
        pagination, filtering by conversation type, and granular OAuth scopes to
        ensure apps only  access authorized data. Developers use it to find the
        right place to post, fetch context for  workflows, manage membership,
        and build features that traverse messages and threads across a 
        workspace (including Slack Connect channels when permitted).

      title: Slack Dialog API
      description: >-
        Slack's Dialog API lets apps open form-like popups inside Slack to
        collect structured  input from users. Apps trigger a dialog (often from
        a slash command, message action,  or interactive message) by calling
        dialog.open with a short-lived trigger_id, then  present fields like
        text inputs, textareas, and select menus (including dynamic, 
        server-powered options). When users submit or cancel, Slack sends a
        dialog_submission  or dialog_cancellation payload to the app, which can
        validate inputs and send  dialog_errors for inline feedback before
        completing the workflow. Dialogs are ephemeral  to the user and
        well-suited for tasks like creating tickets, requesting PTO, or 
        gathering parameters. Note: Slack now recommends using Block Kit modals
        via the  Views API, which supersede legacy dialogs.

      title: Slack Dnd API
      description: >-
        Slack's Do Not Disturb (DND) API lets apps read and manage users'
        notification quiet  time so they don't get pinged when they've paused
        alerts. With the dnd:read and dnd:write  scopes, an app can check a
        user's current DND state and scheduled quiet hours, retrieve  team-wide
        DND summaries (where permitted), start or extend a snooze for a
        specified  duration, and end snooze or active DND. Key methods include
        dnd.info, dnd.teamInfo,  dnd.setSnooze, dnd.endSnooze, and dnd.endDnd.
        Responses provide whether DND is enabled  and timestamps for when it
        starts and ends, enabling apps to defer messages, schedule  work, or
        adjust notification behavior. The API is designed to respect user
        preferences  and workspace policies; apps should handle rate limits and
        note that they can set  temporary snoozes but cannot programmatically
        change a user's full DND schedule.

      title: Slack Files API
      description: >-
        Slack's Files API lets apps programmatically upload, share, and manage
        files in Slack.  Apps can upload binaries (images, docs, code snippets)
        or register links to external files,  then attach them to channels, DMs,
        or threads with optional captions. The API supports  retrieving file
        metadata and content, listing and filtering files, generating or
        revoking  public share links, and deleting files, with access controlled
        by app scopes and channel  membership. For large uploads, a two-step
        flow provides an upload URL before finalizing  the file, and related
        Events API notifications (for example, file_created and file_shared) 
        let apps react to changes. Common uses include import/export pipelines,
        compliance and  archiving tools, and integrations with cloud storage.

      title: Slack Migration API
      description: >-
        Slack's Migration API is a Web API used during Enterprise Grid
        migrations to translate legacy, workspace-scoped identifiers into their
        new, canonical IDs so apps keep working after a workspace moves or
        merges. By calling its migration.exchange method, developers and admins
        can map old user and channel IDs to the new values that Slack assigns in
        an Enterprise Grid org, allowing databases, webhooks, event
        subscriptions, and app configurations to be updated without losing
        references. It complements Admin and SCIM APIs in a migration runbook,
        but it doesn't move content or provision accounts—it strictly provides
        ID remapping to preserve continuity.

      title: Slack Oauth API
      description: >-
        The Slack OAuth API implements the OAuth 2.0 flow that lets developers
        securely install Slack apps to workspaces and obtain access tokens with
        specific, granular scopes. An app redirects a user to Slack for consent;
        after approval, Slack returns an authorization code that the app
        exchanges for tokens (typically a bot token, and optionally a user
        token) to call the Web API within the granted permissions. The OAuth
        system manages scopes, workspace and enterprise installations, admin
        approvals, reauthorization when scopes change, token rotation with
        refresh tokens, and revocation when apps are uninstalled or access is
        removed. For user sign-in, Slack also offers an OpenID Connect-based
        flow. In short, it provides consent-driven installation, permissioning,
        and token lifecycle management for Slack apps.

      title: Slack Pins API
      description: >-
        The Slack Pins API is a set of Web API methods that let your app manage
        pinned items in conversations so important content is easy to find. With
        pins.add, pins.list, and pins.remove, you can programmatically pin or
        unpin messages, files, and file comments in channels, private channels,
        and DMs by providing the conversation ID and the message timestamp or
        file/comment ID. Pinned items surface in the conversation's details
        panel in the Slack client, and pins.list returns the same set so your
        app can mirror or analyze it. These methods require your app to be a
        member of the conversation and have appropriate permissions, and they
        observe Slack's standard rate limits.

      title: Slack Reactions API
      description: >-
        Slack's Reactions API lets apps programmatically manage emoji reactions
        on messages and files, making it easy to capture lightweight feedback
        like approvals, acknowledgments, or votes. Through Web API methods
        (reactions.add, reactions.remove, reactions.get, reactions.list) and the
        Events API (reaction_added and reaction_removed), apps can add or delete
        reactions, read which reactions are on an item, and monitor reaction
        activity in real time. It works with messages (including threads),
        files, and file comments in channels, DMs, and group DMs where the app
        has access. Responses include reaction names, counts, and user IDs, and
        support both standard and custom emoji. Proper scopes (reactions:read
        and reactions:write, plus relevant conversation/file scopes) and channel
        visibility rules apply, rate limits are enforced, and each user can
        apply at most one instance of a given emoji per item.

      title: Slack Reminders API
      description: >-
        Slack's Reminders API lets apps create and manage personal reminders for
        Slack users, so teams can automate nudges, follow-ups, and routine
        check-ins without leaving Slack. Through Web API methods, an app can add
        reminders with natural language or timestamps (including recurring
        patterns like "every Monday at 9am"), list a user's upcoming reminders,
        fetch details, and mark or delete them when done. It's useful for
        workflows like task handoffs, compliance pings, or lightweight to-dos
        that need to surface at the right moment. Access is controlled with
        granular OAuth scopes (reminders:write and reminders:read), and
        reminders are delivered inside Slack where users already communicate,
        keeping prompts contextual and unobtrusive.

      title: Slack Rtm API
      description: >-
        The Slack Real Time Messaging (RTM) API lets an app open a WebSocket
        connection to Slack and receive a live stream of JSON events from a
        workspace—such as new messages, edits, reactions, user presence and
        typing indicators, channel joins, and more—so you can build low-latency,
        interactive bots and clients. Apps typically use the RTM stream for
        listening and the Web API for performing actions like posting or
        updating messages. You start by calling rtm.connect (or rtm.start,
        historically) to obtain a WebSocket URL, then maintain the socket to
        process events as they happen. RTM is now considered legacy; for new
        apps Slack recommends using the Events API with the Web API, or Socket
        Mode if you can't expose a public HTTP endpoint.

        Slack's Search API lets apps programmatically find messages and files in
        a workspace  using the same query syntax users have in Slack (e.g., in:,
        from:, has:, before:/after:, is:thread).  Through endpoints like
        search.messages and search.files, it returns ranked matches with
        snippets  and optional highlighting, plus rich metadata such as channel,
        timestamps, user, thread context,  permalinks, and file details. You can
        sort by relevance or time, filter with operators, and page  through
        results. All results respect the app's scopes and the workspace's
        permissions, retention,  and data controls, and the methods are subject
        to rate limits.

      title: Slack Stars API
      description: >-
        The Slack Stars API is a set of Web API methods that let apps manage a
        user's starred items -  Slack's legacy personal bookmarking feature. It
        allows adding or removing a star on items such  as messages (via channel
        and timestamp), files, and file comments, and listing all items a user 
        has starred, typically with pagination and basic metadata. Stars are
        user-specific and don't  alter the underlying content; they simply mark
        things for quick reference. Note that Slack has  moved toward Saved
        items and other mechanisms in the client, and the stars.* methods have
        been  deprecated, so availability and support may be limited.

        billing data. With it, apps can fetch basic  workspace identity and
        metadata (name, domain, icon, enterprise association), discover team 
        preferences and custom profile fields, and, where permitted, retrieve
        billable info plus  access and integration logs for auditing and

      description: >-
        Slack's User Groups API lets apps programmatically create and manage
        user groups (mentionable aliases like @eng or @oncall) in a workspace.
        It supports creating, renaming, and updating groups and their handles
        and descriptions; setting default channels; enabling or disabling
        groups; listing groups; and adding or removing members in bulk. User
        groups make it easy to notify the right people with a single mention and
        to auto-add members to specific channels via default channel settings.
        Teams use the API to automate org changes, sync groups from an identity
        provider, manage on-call rotations, and streamline
        onboarding/offboarding. It's exposed via Use Groups.* and Use
        Groups.users.* Web API methods and typically requires the Use
        Groups:read and Use Groups:write scopes, with appropriate admin
        permissions and a paid Slack plan.

        details for a specific user, look up users by email, and retrieve
        profile data such as names, photos, status, time zones, and custom
        fields. Where permitted, it can also read presence and update a user's
        profile or photo with the proper user-level authorization. Developers
        use it to map real identities to Slack user IDs, personalize
        experiences, resolve mentions and DMs, and distinguish between human,
        bot, and app users. Access to specific data and actions depends on
        scopes (for example, users:read, users:read.email,
        users.profile:read/write), and certain capabilities like presence have
        additional restrictions. For provisioning and enterprise directory
        management, Slack's SCIM API is used instead.

        views.open, views.update, and views.push, your app can launch multi-step
        modal flows in response to interactive triggers (slash commands,
        shortcuts, or message actions), update them in place, or push new steps
        onto the stack. Using views.publish, you can render a personalized,

    - title: Slack Admin API
      description: >-
        The Slack Admin API is a set of privileged endpoints primarily under
        admin.* with related SCIM and Audit Logs APIs that lets Enterprise Grid
        owners and admins automate organization-wide management and governance.
        It covers user lifecycle (provision, suspend, assign roles), workspace
        and channel administration across workspaces (create, move, archive
        channels; manage membership and settings), app governance (approve/deny
        or allowlist/ban apps and install them to workspaces), invite request
        handling, and security/compliance controls such as information barriers,
        session and authentication policies, and org-level analytics exports.
      entity: backstage/slack-admin-api-sandbox-backstage.yml
    - title: Slack Apps API
      description: >-
        The Slack Apps API is a set of platform APIs and tools that let
        developers build apps to extend Slack and automate work. With it, you
        can read and write data via the Web API (messages, channels, files,
        reactions), receive real-time events using the Events API or Socket
        Mode, and create interactive experiences with Block Kit, modals,
        buttons, shortcuts, and slash commands. Apps can post messages, run
        workflows, add custom steps to Workflow Builder, manage conversations,
        and act as bot users. Installation uses OAuth 2.0 with granular
        permission scopes and token types, and enterprise features are supported
        through admin APIs.
      entity: backstage/slack-apps-api-sandbox-backstage.yml
    - title: Slack Auth API
      description: >-
        Slack's Auth API covers the authentication and authorization pieces that
        let apps securely identify users and workspaces and manage access. It
        includes OAuth 2.0 endpoints used during app installation to request
        scopes and exchange authorization codes for tokens (with optional token
        rotation), plus OpenID Connect for "Sign in with Slack" so you can
        authenticate users and retrieve standard identity claims. Within the Web
        API, methods like auth.test let you verify a token and learn which user
        and workspace it belongs to, auth.revoke allows you to invalidate
        tokens, and auth.teams.list helps enumerate the workspaces a user can
        use with your app (useful for multi-workspace and Enterprise Grid
        scenarios). Together, these capabilities ensure your app knows who is
        calling, what it's allowed to do, and where, before invoking other Slack
        APIs.
      entity: backstage/slack-auth-api-sandbox-backstage.yml
    - title: Slack Bots API
      description: "Slack\x19s bot APIs let you build apps that live in Slack and automate work by listening for events and taking actions in conversations. Using the Web API, your bot can post and schedule messages, reply in threads, manage channels, look up users, and access files or reactions; the Events API delivers message, reaction, and workflow events to your server so you can respond in real time. Bots can power slash commands, message shortcuts, and interactive UI elements (buttons, menus, modals built with Block Kit), and they can open modals or update messages dynamically. Installation and access are controlled via OAuth 2.0 scopes, with bot tokens used to authenticate API calls; you can receive events over HTTPS or via Socket Mode if you don\x19t host a public endpoint. Together, these capabilities let you create assistants that answer questions, route approvals, connect external services, and streamline team processes directly inside Slack."
      entity: backstage/slack-bots-api-sandbox-backstage.yml
    - title: Slack Calls API
      description: >-
        Slack's Calls API lets apps represent third-party voice or video calls
        inside Slack  by creating a "call" object with a join URL and metadata,
        so users see a rich call  message with a Join button, status, and
        participant list in channels or DMs. Through  endpoints to create,
        update, and end calls—and to add or remove participants—an app  can keep
        that call message in sync as people join or leave and as the call
        progresses.  The API doesn't handle the media itself; it's for
        coordinating and rendering the Slack  UI around calls hosted by services
        like Zoom or Webex, making it easy to start, find,  and join those calls
        from Slack.
      entity: backstage/slack-calls-api-sandbox-backstage.yml
    - title: Slack Chat API
      description: >-
        The Slack Chat API is the set of chat.* methods in the Slack Web API
        that lets apps and bots create and manage messages in Slack workspaces.
        It enables posting messages to channels and DMs with Block Kit
        formatting, sending ephemeral messages visible only to a specific user,
        replying in threads, scheduling messages for later delivery, updating or
        deleting existing messages, retrieving permalinks, and providing custom
        link unfurls. These methods work over HTTP with JSON payloads, use
        bot/user tokens with scopes like chat:write and chat:write.public, and
        return metadata such as channel, ts, and thread_ts. Teams use the Chat
        API to automate notifications, power interactive workflows, and deliver
        rich conversational experiences inside Slack.
      entity: backstage/slack-chat-api-sandbox-backstage.yml
    - title: Slack Conversations API
      description: >-
        The Slack Conversations API is the unified Web API for working with all
        types of Slack  conversations—public and private channels, direct
        messages, and multi-person DMs. It lets  apps discover and inspect
        conversations, list members, and read message history and threads,  as
        well as create, join, invite, leave, and archive channels where
        permissions allow. By  consolidating the legacy channels.*, groups.*,
        im.*, and mpim.* endpoints into conversations.*,  it provides consistent
        IDs and behavior across conversation types. It supports cursor-based 
        pagination, filtering by conversation type, and granular OAuth scopes to
        ensure apps only  access authorized data. Developers use it to find the
        right place to post, fetch context for  workflows, manage membership,
        and build features that traverse messages and threads across a 
        workspace (including Slack Connect channels when permitted).
      entity: backstage/slack-conversations-api-sandbox-backstage.yml
    - title: Slack Dialog API
      description: >-
        Slack's Dialog API lets apps open form-like popups inside Slack to
        collect structured  input from users. Apps trigger a dialog (often from
        a slash command, message action,  or interactive message) by calling
        dialog.open with a short-lived trigger_id, then  present fields like
        text inputs, textareas, and select menus (including dynamic, 
        server-powered options). When users submit or cancel, Slack sends a
        dialog_submission  or dialog_cancellation payload to the app, which can
        validate inputs and send  dialog_errors for inline feedback before
        completing the workflow. Dialogs are ephemeral  to the user and
        well-suited for tasks like creating tickets, requesting PTO, or 
        gathering parameters. Note: Slack now recommends using Block Kit modals
        via the  Views API, which supersede legacy dialogs.
      entity: backstage/slack-dialog-api-sandbox-backstage.yml
    - title: Slack Dnd API
      description: >-
        Slack's Do Not Disturb (DND) API lets apps read and manage users'
        notification quiet  time so they don't get pinged when they've paused
        alerts. With the dnd:read and dnd:write  scopes, an app can check a
        user's current DND state and scheduled quiet hours, retrieve  team-wide
        DND summaries (where permitted), start or extend a snooze for a
        specified  duration, and end snooze or active DND. Key methods include
        dnd.info, dnd.teamInfo,  dnd.setSnooze, dnd.endSnooze, and dnd.endDnd.
        Responses provide whether DND is enabled  and timestamps for when it
        starts and ends, enabling apps to defer messages, schedule  work, or
        adjust notification behavior. The API is designed to respect user
        preferences  and workspace policies; apps should handle rate limits and
        note that they can set  temporary snoozes but cannot programmatically
        change a user's full DND schedule.
      entity: backstage/slack-dnd-api-sandbox-backstage.yml
    - title: Slack Files API
      description: >-
        Slack's Files API lets apps programmatically upload, share, and manage
        files in Slack.  Apps can upload binaries (images, docs, code snippets)
        or register links to external files,  then attach them to channels, DMs,
        or threads with optional captions. The API supports  retrieving file
        metadata and content, listing and filtering files, generating or
        revoking  public share links, and deleting files, with access controlled
        by app scopes and channel  membership. For large uploads, a two-step
        flow provides an upload URL before finalizing  the file, and related
        Events API notifications (for example, file_created and file_shared) 
        let apps react to changes. Common uses include import/export pipelines,
        compliance and  archiving tools, and integrations with cloud storage.
      entity: backstage/slack-files-api-sandbox-backstage.yml
    - title: Slack Migration API
      description: >-
        Slack's Migration API is a Web API used during Enterprise Grid
        migrations to translate legacy, workspace-scoped identifiers into their
        new, canonical IDs so apps keep working after a workspace moves or
        merges. By calling its migration.exchange method, developers and admins
        can map old user and channel IDs to the new values that Slack assigns in
        an Enterprise Grid org, allowing databases, webhooks, event
        subscriptions, and app configurations to be updated without losing
        references. It complements Admin and SCIM APIs in a migration runbook,
        but it doesn't move content or provision accounts—it strictly provides
        ID remapping to preserve continuity.
      entity: backstage/slack-migration-api-sandbox-backstage.yml
    - title: Slack Oauth API
      description: >-
        The Slack OAuth API implements the OAuth 2.0 flow that lets developers
        securely install Slack apps to workspaces and obtain access tokens with
        specific, granular scopes. An app redirects a user to Slack for consent;
        after approval, Slack returns an authorization code that the app
        exchanges for tokens (typically a bot token, and optionally a user
        token) to call the Web API within the granted permissions. The OAuth
        system manages scopes, workspace and enterprise installations, admin
        approvals, reauthorization when scopes change, token rotation with
        refresh tokens, and revocation when apps are uninstalled or access is
        removed. For user sign-in, Slack also offers an OpenID Connect-based
        flow. In short, it provides consent-driven installation, permissioning,
        and token lifecycle management for Slack apps.
      entity: backstage/slack-oauth-api-sandbox-backstage.yml
    - title: Slack Pins API
      description: >-
        The Slack Pins API is a set of Web API methods that let your app manage
        pinned items in conversations so important content is easy to find. With
        pins.add, pins.list, and pins.remove, you can programmatically pin or
        unpin messages, files, and file comments in channels, private channels,
        and DMs by providing the conversation ID and the message timestamp or
        file/comment ID. Pinned items surface in the conversation's details
        panel in the Slack client, and pins.list returns the same set so your
        app can mirror or analyze it. These methods require your app to be a
        member of the conversation and have appropriate permissions, and they
        observe Slack's standard rate limits.
      entity: backstage/slack-pins-api-sandbox-backstage.yml
    - title: Slack Reactions API
      description: >-
        Slack's Reactions API lets apps programmatically manage emoji reactions
        on messages and files, making it easy to capture lightweight feedback
        like approvals, acknowledgments, or votes. Through Web API methods
        (reactions.add, reactions.remove, reactions.get, reactions.list) and the
        Events API (reaction_added and reaction_removed), apps can add or delete
        reactions, read which reactions are on an item, and monitor reaction
        activity in real time. It works with messages (including threads),
        files, and file comments in channels, DMs, and group DMs where the app
        has access. Responses include reaction names, counts, and user IDs, and
        support both standard and custom emoji. Proper scopes (reactions:read
        and reactions:write, plus relevant conversation/file scopes) and channel
        visibility rules apply, rate limits are enforced, and each user can
        apply at most one instance of a given emoji per item.
      entity: backstage/slack-reactions-api-sandbox-backstage.yml
    - title: Slack Reminders API
      description: >-
        Slack's Reminders API lets apps create and manage personal reminders for
        Slack users, so teams can automate nudges, follow-ups, and routine
        check-ins without leaving Slack. Through Web API methods, an app can add
        reminders with natural language or timestamps (including recurring
        patterns like "every Monday at 9am"), list a user's upcoming reminders,
        fetch details, and mark or delete them when done. It's useful for
        workflows like task handoffs, compliance pings, or lightweight to-dos
        that need to surface at the right moment. Access is controlled with
        granular OAuth scopes (reminders:write and reminders:read), and
        reminders are delivered inside Slack where users already communicate,
        keeping prompts contextual and unobtrusive.
      entity: backstage/slack-reminders-api-sandbox-backstage.yml
    - title: Slack Rtm API
      description: >-
        The Slack Real Time Messaging (RTM) API lets an app open a WebSocket
        connection to Slack and receive a live stream of JSON events from a
        workspace—such as new messages, edits, reactions, user presence and
        typing indicators, channel joins, and more—so you can build low-latency,
        interactive bots and clients. Apps typically use the RTM stream for
        listening and the Web API for performing actions like posting or
        updating messages. You start by calling rtm.connect (or rtm.start,
        historically) to obtain a WebSocket URL, then maintain the socket to
        process events as they happen. RTM is now considered legacy; for new
        apps Slack recommends using the Events API with the Web API, or Socket
        Mode if you can't expose a public HTTP endpoint.
      entity: backstage/slack-rtm-api-sandbox-backstage.yml
    - title: Slack Search API
      description: >-
        Slack's Search API lets apps programmatically find messages and files in
        a workspace  using the same query syntax users have in Slack (e.g., in:,
        from:, has:, before:/after:, is:thread).  Through endpoints like
        search.messages and search.files, it returns ranked matches with
        snippets  and optional highlighting, plus rich metadata such as channel,
        timestamps, user, thread context,  permalinks, and file details. You can
        sort by relevance or time, filter with operators, and page  through
        results. All results respect the app's scopes and the workspace's
        permissions, retention,  and data controls, and the methods are subject
        to rate limits.
      entity: backstage/slack-search-api-sandbox-backstage.yml
    - title: Slack Stars API
      description: >-
        The Slack Stars API is a set of Web API methods that let apps manage a
        user's starred items -  Slack's legacy personal bookmarking feature. It
        allows adding or removing a star on items such  as messages (via channel
        and timestamp), files, and file comments, and listing all items a user 
        has starred, typically with pagination and basic metadata. Stars are
        user-specific and don't  alter the underlying content; they simply mark
        things for quick reference. Note that Slack has  moved toward Saved
        items and other mechanisms in the client, and the stars.* methods have
        been  deprecated, so availability and support may be limited.
      entity: backstage/slack-stars-api-sandbox-backstage.yml
    - title: Slack Team API
      description: >-
        Slack's Team API is the part of the Slack Web API that lets apps read
        workspace-level (team)  information and, for admins, certain audit and
        billing data. With it, apps can fetch basic  workspace identity and
        metadata (name, domain, icon, enterprise association), discover team 
        preferences and custom profile fields, and, where permitted, retrieve
        billable info plus  access and integration logs for auditing and
        compliance use cases.
      entity: backstage/slack-team-api-sandbox-backstage.yml
    - title: Slack Tests API
      description: >-
        The Slack Tests API provides endpoints for testing API calling code. 
        Developers use this API to validate their Slack integration setup,  test
        error handling, and verify connectivity to the Slack platform  before
        deploying production applications.
      entity: backstage/slack-test-api-api-sandbox-backstage.yml
    - title: Slack User Groups API
      description: >-
        Slack's User Groups API lets apps programmatically create and manage
        user groups (mentionable aliases like @eng or @oncall) in a workspace.
        It supports creating, renaming, and updating groups and their handles
        and descriptions; setting default channels; enabling or disabling
        groups; listing groups; and adding or removing members in bulk. User
        groups make it easy to notify the right people with a single mention and
        to auto-add members to specific channels via default channel settings.
        Teams use the API to automate org changes, sync groups from an identity
        provider, manage on-call rotations, and streamline
        onboarding/offboarding. It's exposed via Use Groups.* and Use
        Groups.users.* Web API methods and typically requires the Use
        Groups:read and Use Groups:write scopes, with appropriate admin
        permissions and a paid Slack plan.
      entity: backstage/slack-usergroups-api-sandbox-backstage.yml
    - title: Slack Users API
      description: >-
        Slack's Users API is a set of Web API methods that let your app discover
        and work with people in a Slack workspace. It can list members, fetch
        details for a specific user, look up users by email, and retrieve
        profile data such as names, photos, status, time zones, and custom
        fields. Where permitted, it can also read presence and update a user's
        profile or photo with the proper user-level authorization. Developers
        use it to map real identities to Slack user IDs, personalize
        experiences, resolve mentions and DMs, and distinguish between human,
        bot, and app users. Access to specific data and actions depends on
        scopes (for example, users:read, users:read.email,
        users.profile:read/write), and certain capabilities like presence have
        additional restrictions. For provisioning and enterprise directory
        management, Slack's SCIM API is used instead.
      entity: backstage/slack-users-api-sandbox-backstage.yml
    - title: Slack Views API
      description: >-
        The Slack Views API lets your app build and control Block Kit interfaces
        inside Slack—primarily modals and the App Home tab. With methods like
        views.open, views.update, and views.push, your app can launch multi-step
        modal flows in response to interactive triggers (slash commands,
        shortcuts, or message actions), update them in place, or push new steps
        onto the stack. Using views.publish, you can render a personalized,
        dynamic Home tab for each user.
      entity: backstage/slack-views-api-sandbox-backstage.yml
    - title: Slack Workflows API
      description: >-
        The Slack Workflows API enables apps to build custom workflow steps that
        integrate with Slack's Workflow Builder. Apps can indicate when steps
        complete or fail execution, and update step configurations including
        inputs, outputs, and display properties.
