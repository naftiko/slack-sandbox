        The Slack Admin API is a set of privileged endpoints primarily under
        admin.* with related SCIM and Audit Logs APIs that lets Enterprise Grid
        owners and admins automate organization-wide management and governance.
        It covers user lifecycle (provision, suspend, assign roles), workspace
        and channel administration across workspaces (create, move, archive
        channels; manage membership and settings), app governance (approve/deny
        or allowlist/ban apps and install them to workspaces), invite request
        handling, and security/compliance controls such as information barriers,
        session and authentication policies, and org-level analytics exports.

        The Slack Apps API is a set of platform APIs and tools that let
        developers build apps to extend Slack and automate work. With it, you
        can read and write data via the Web API (messages, channels, files,
        reactions), receive real-time events using the Events API or Socket
        Mode, and create interactive experiences with Block Kit, modals,
        buttons, shortcuts, and slash commands. Apps can post messages, run
        workflows, add custom steps to Workflow Builder, manage conversations,
        and act as bot users. Installation uses OAuth 2.0 with granular
        permission scopes and token types, and enterprise features are supported
        through admin APIs.

        Slack's Auth API covers the authentication and authorization pieces that
        let apps securely identify users and workspaces and manage access. It
        includes OAuth 2.0 endpoints used during app installation to request
        scopes and exchange authorization codes for tokens (with optional token
        rotation), plus OpenID Connect for "Sign in with Slack" so you can
        authenticate users and retrieve standard identity claims. Within the Web
        API, methods like auth.test let you verify a token and learn which user
        and workspace it belongs to, auth.revoke allows you to invalidate
        tokens, and auth.teams.list helps enumerate the workspaces a user can
        use with your app (useful for multi-workspace and Enterprise Grid
        scenarios). Together, these capabilities ensure your app knows who is
        calling, what it's allowed to do, and where, before invoking other Slack
        APIs.

        Slack's bot APIs let you build apps that live in Slack and automate work
        by listening for events and taking actions in conversations. Using the
        Web API, your bot can post and schedule messages, reply in threads,
        manage channels, look up users, and access files or reactions; the
        Events API delivers message, reaction, and workflow events to your
        server so you can respond in real time. Bots can power slash commands,
        message shortcuts, and interactive UI elements (buttons, menus, modals
        built with Block Kit), and they can open modals or update messages
        dynamically. Installation and access are controlled via OAuth 2.0
        scopes, with bot tokens used to authenticate API calls.

        Slack's Calls API lets apps represent third-party voice or video calls
        inside Slack by creating a "call" object with a join URL and metadata,
        so users see a rich call message with a Join button, status, and
        participant list in channels or DMs. Through endpoints to create,
        update, and end calls—and to add or remove participants—an app can keep
        that call message in sync as people join or leave and as the call
        progresses. The API doesn't handle the media itself; it's for
        coordinating and rendering the Slack UI around calls hosted by services
        like Zoom or Webex.

        The Slack Chat API is the set of chat.* methods in the Slack Web API
        that lets apps and bots create and manage messages in Slack workspaces.
        It enables posting messages to channels and DMs with Block Kit
        formatting, sending ephemeral messages visible only to a specific user,
        replying in threads, scheduling messages for later delivery, updating or
        deleting existing messages, retrieving permalinks, and providing custom
        link unfurls. These methods work over HTTP with JSON payloads, use
        bot/user tokens with scopes like chat:write and chat:write.public, and
        return metadata such as channel, ts, and thread_ts.

        conversations, list members, and read message history and threads, as
        well as create, join, invite, leave, and archive channels where
        permissions allow. By consolidating the legacy channels.*, groups.*,

        Slack's Dialog API lets apps open form-like popups inside Slack to
        collect structured input from users. Apps trigger a dialog (often from
        a slash command, message action, or interactive message) by calling
        dialog.open with a short-lived trigger_id, then present fields like
        text inputs, textareas, and select menus (including dynamic,
        server-powered options). When users submit or cancel, Slack sends a
        dialog_submission or dialog_cancellation payload to the app. Note:
        Slack now recommends using Block Kit modals via the Views API, which
        supersede legacy dialogs.

        notification quiet time so they don't get pinged when they've paused
        alerts. With the dnd:read and dnd:write scopes, an app can check a
        user's current DND state and scheduled quiet hours, retrieve team-wide
        DND summaries (where permitted), start or extend a snooze for a
        specified duration, and end snooze or active DND. Key methods include
        dnd.info, dnd.teamInfo, dnd.setSnooze, dnd.endSnooze, and dnd.endDnd.

        or register links to external files, then attach them to channels, DMs,
        or threads with optional captions. The API supports retrieving file
        metadata and content, listing and filtering files, generating or

        new, canonical IDs so apps keep working after a workspace moves or
        merges. By calling its migration.exchange method, developers and admins
        can map old user and channel IDs to the new values that Slack assigns in
        an Enterprise Grid org, allowing databases, webhooks, event
        subscriptions, and app configurations to be updated without losing

        The Slack OAuth API implements the OAuth 2.0 flow that lets developers
        securely install Slack apps to workspaces and obtain access tokens with
        specific, granular scopes. An app redirects a user to Slack for consent;
        after approval, Slack returns an authorization code that the app
        exchanges for tokens (typically a bot token, and optionally a user
        token) to call the Web API within the granted permissions. The OAuth
        system manages scopes, workspace and enterprise installations, admin
        approvals, reauthorization when scopes change, token rotation with
        refresh tokens, and revocation when apps are uninstalled or access is
        removed.

        Slack's Team API is the part of the Slack Web API that lets apps read
        workspace-level (team) information and, for admins, certain audit and
        billing data. With it, apps can fetch basic workspace identity and
        metadata (name, domain, icon, enterprise association), discover team
        preferences and custom profile fields, and, where permitted, retrieve
        billable info plus access and integration logs for auditing and
        compliance use cases.

        Slack's Users API is a set of Web API methods that let your app discover
        and work with people in a Slack workspace. It can list members, fetch
        details for a specific user, look up users by email, and retrieve
        profile data such as names, photos, status, time zones, and custom
        fields. Where permitted, it can also read presence and update a user's
        profile or photo with the proper user-level authorization.

        The Slack Views API lets your app build and control Block Kit interfaces
        inside Slack—primarily modals and the App Home tab. With methods like
        views.open, views.update, and views.push, your app can launch multi-step
        modal flows in response to interactive triggers (slash commands,
        shortcuts, or message actions), update them in place, or push new steps
        onto the stack. Using views.publish, you can render a personalized,
        dynamic Home tab for each user.
